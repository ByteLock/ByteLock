# Hey! :wave: Welcome to my corner!
Im Dennis, I code in a few different languages, some more proficiently than others of course :laughing: I spend most of my time either developing software either in **C** or sometimes I like to make backend **REST APIs** using **Gulp.js** and sometimes even **Express.js**
